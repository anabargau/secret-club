# Secret-club

A project made with Node/Express, Pug, and CSS to practice PassportJS.
An exclusive club where you can sign up to see other peoples's messages, but the identity of each message's author is visible only to insider members. You can become an insider by entering a password. After you become an insider, you can also become an admin by entering another password. The admin is the only one who can also delete message. I learned how to use passportJS to authenticate users, sign up, log out and create sessions.

password for insider membership: apple
to become admin: pear
