# Secret-club

A project made with Node/Express, Pug, and CSS to practice PassportJS.
An exclusive club where you can sign up to see other peoples's messages, but the identity of each message's author is visible only to insider members. You can become an insider by entering a password. After you become an insider, you can also become an admin by entering another password. The admin is the only one who can also delete message. I learned how to use passportJS to authenticate users, sign up, log out and create sessions.

At first you will be able to see the messages, but won't be able to see who the author is.

But after signing up and becoming an insider, you will also be able to see who wrote the message.

Also, you will be able to add your own message.

There is another level to reach: the one of admin, after entering another password. This way you will have full control and will also be able to delete the messages.
